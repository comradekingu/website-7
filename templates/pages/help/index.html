## Get Help, Give Suggestions, Report Bugs

Joining the [Drawpile Discord Server](https://discord.gg/M3yyMpC) is probably
the easiest way to get help, since there's a number of nice people at the ready
to answer questions and provide assistance. It's also a good place to keep up
with the latest development, provide suggestions, report issues and so on.

You can also report stuff in the
[GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/drawpile/Drawpile/issues) directly if
you like. This website has [its own Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/drawpile/website/issues) as well.

Or look at the help pages below, maybe your issue already has a page!
