The website has just received a technical overhaul. While the overall layout remains the same, the site is now powered by Django. (Previously, it was a static site generated with Hyde.) This makes it possible to add dynamic features in the future, such as username registration for the public server and user galleries.

The source code for the website is now fully open and can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/drawpile/website). I will accept pull requests if you have ideas for improvement or even just typo fixes.
